Changes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are those rules where changes were made either for improvement,
or due to implementation issues.

* Bases - These do not automatically limit arc and armor for weapons and 
	systems	based on the side/section they appear (I gather this was done due 
	to space restrictions on the SCS), rather it is left up to the unit 
	designer to conform or not as desired

* Connecting Struts - Must be added as a system to the appropriate section(s) 
	on the vessel, in addition to adding in hit location chart
	

Unsupported
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are those rules where support/implementation is not planned.
	
* Refits (WotCR page 24) - No support planned, instead use separate definition 
	for each time period, and use model field for refit year
	
* Early Versions (e.g. Torata Colotnar Defense Base) - No support planned, 
	instead use separate definition for each time period
	
* Ipsha Power Enhancement Pod (e.g. Ipsha Tetra Escort) - No support planned, 
	instead use separate definition for with and without
	
* Turning in Reverse: add +1/3 to turn cost (Hyach Alichi Kav Stealth Cruiser)
	- No support planned 

* +1 initiative while flight commander is alive and uninjured (Dilgar Thorun 
	Dartfighters Mk-II & Mk-III) - No support planned, going to assume flight
	commander is last to fall and add +1 initiative bonus to combat stats
